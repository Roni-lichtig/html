    <h1 style="text-align: center;color: blue;">Explore The Solar System</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 12px; font-family: Arial; text-align: left;">The Solar System is a fascinating collection of planets, moons, asteroids, and comets orbiting our star â€“ the Sun. 
        From the scorching surface of Mercury to the icy winds of Neptune, each planet offers a unique glimpse into the wonders of space. 
        Earth, our home, is the only known planet to support life, while Mars continues to be a major target for future exploration. 
        Jupiter, the largest planet, has a powerful magnetic field and dozens of moons, including Europa, which may contain an ocean beneath its icy crust. 
        As technology advances, scientists are uncovering more secrets of the solar system, bringing us closer to understanding the universe and our place within it.
